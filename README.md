# GroovySandbox

I have created this groovy sandbox while I learn the language. Nothing here of
interest for most people.

## ExchangeRate.groovy

This is my first groovy script. I was experimenting with RESTful API's, opening
files, JSON and command line options.

```
usage: groovy ExchangeRate [options] <currency/search>
    --currencies   Displays all available currencies
    --disclaimer   Display disclaimer
 -h,--help         Displays usage
    --license      Display license agreement
 -s,--search       Search for a currency code
```
